It's not actually a security vulnerability or a risk of getting hacked, it's a lack of following basic best practices for running a website and the protection of your valued customers. A simple effort by whoever manages your site to enable ssl and buy a ssl cert for minimal cost is all that needed to respect your customers right to privacy and security and solidify trust. Unfortunately many customers are unaware of risks on the Internet. That's not their fault yet rather a lack of education.

It's like, if you've ever cleaned your face with alcohol, or accidentally inhale the fumes, you get that signature burn from it. It's just like that, except I'm literally vaporizing it and breathing it into my lungs. Leaves a terrible tas te on my tongue too. It's awful. I definitely won't be doing business with them in the future. I sincerely appreciate the coupon code. Even more so, I ap preciate the time you took to inform me about that. I was unaware that some blends use alcohol. That's strange, as I'd think the mix of pg and vg would b e enough of a solvent to carry everything. Perhaps because alcohol is cheap? I just wish I had known that. But I will certainly give your product a try. I admire the closeness and connection that you create with the customer. Someone on reddit said you're unsurpassed in customer service, and I can certain ly agree with that. I've never seen seen a business offer such engagement with the customer.

I was not given a choice  of ratio. It's 50/50. I also ordered a bottle of tobacco flavor, as I have been curious about it  (vaping allowed me to quit smoking cigarettes). The to bacco is 80pg/20vg. Gummy bears is 3mg, tobacco is 6. I've had Lush brand gummy bears in18mg when I first started, and that was really good, although now , I can't even imagine vaping 18mgs. But I certainly did not expect this. The rep assured me that there is no alcohol in the mix, and suggested I let it ""breathe"" for about a month. A month? Yes. A month.

Had an ego style pen for several months, and just last month, upgraded to the Kanger Topbox Mini. I'm still figuring out all the ""this and that's"" associated with it. One thing I've wanted to do is start buying e liquid online, as it gets very expensive at shops. I did this with theecig.com, and to my dismay, it literally tasted like isopropyl alcoh ol. Un-vapeable. Someone on reddit recommend you guys, and I before I take the chance, I was simply wondering if it's a complaint you've ever had. The gu y at the e cig told me it was normal. If that's ""normal"", then I'm surprised people even vape. I've tried about half a dozen brands, and I've never encou ntered that. I was torn between your cactus fruit flavor (grew up in the AZ desert) and your Dragon's Milk flavor. But before I spend any money (which is  rapidly dwindling since the loss of my job), I just wanted to make sure I'm not going to encounter another case of the unexplained rubbing alcovape.

Love your coffee. Glad you opened this shop. Been here (Burlingame location) before, and frequented Middlefield MV/Palo Alto location w hen I lived in MV.

Scene: 
 It's about 5:30pm. Wednesday.
I ordered a Jacob's Dark Roast Tall and paid for my coffee, and stood to wait. There were NO o ther customers ordering or waiting on orders. After about 7 minutes I sat down with my book and told the barista to call me when my coffee was done. I sa t 20 feet away inside the store (downtown Burlingame). I got through several pages of my book and began to wonder. I made eye contact with a few employee s but no one said anything to me until I asked about my coffee. 

The sign on the counter says to ""have a seat and your barista will call on you."" 

One barista said there was a coffee sitting out on the counter-- mine, ni doubt--now cooled off, no lid. 

I asked a new barista standing at the counter, and  he said he'd make another in two minutes. After this tiny debacle I was a bit peeved to have to monitor the making of a second cup. The new barista apol ogized, but the original barista of cup#1 dropped the ball. 

I usually have a good experience at Phil's. This was a small cluster, given that there are at least 4 employees here now under Lisa Marie's shift. 

Doing a better job connecting and following through.

To switch things up, I've been considering pausing my use of May's Youth Dew for daytime and trading that out for something else (not because it isn' t great--smell is amazing and gives a nice glow)...just like to switch things up now and again.

I asked how much it would be roughly and was told less than 100 dollars.  I paid 101.13, not the end of the world but typical auto repair told one price and end up paying more type deal. In my opinion. After I left I noticed t he exhaust didn't sound right. Upon checking the exhaust myself I noticed it was not fully sealed. Had a hole on the top which was causing excessive nois e. Had to take off work early to come back and wait another hour to get the exhaust fixed properly. Not the end of the world but certainly not the best f irst experience at your establishment.

Trayvax, ,SMS-+12517516978,3/17/2016 15:19,19,"I haven’t been able to get anyone on the support phone. I’m with Randall-Reilly, mother company of The Great American Truck Show. We host this show every year in August in Dallas, Texas and we think you could really profit from an exhibit. This is a show full of truckers, hunters, fisherman, executives looking to buy their fleets a gift, etc. 

Last year at GATS, a knife brand came and sold over $40,000 worth of hunting and fishing knives. Just a few months ago, the same company sold $80,000 worth at World of Concrete. 

Seeing that your wallets are durable, dual purpose, aesthetically pleasing, and include utility tools, I think this is a great product offering for our show! If you have time next week we’d love to give you a call and discuss the show, it should only be a 10-15 minute phone call.",813
Philz Coffee - Sunnyvale,"125 S Frances St, Sunnyvale, CA 94086, United States 94086",SMS-+14082422159,3/17/2016 15:16,13,"Hi! I spoke with you a couple of weeks ago regarding window coverings for the Sunnyvale location. How is that going? The weather is beginning to warm up,  which will make it even worse. Today, again, the sun is streaming into the eyes of the baristas while they are trying to do their job. Then, the dub is in our eyes on the way to the way to the cash register. 

At times, early to mid- morning, it is impossible to utilize seating that faces France's street  without sunglasses. In my opinion, Philz is a cutting edge, sophisticated company. Is seems incongruent to me, then, that the company would not want to make their locations as comfortable and efficient as possible for both the baristas and customers. 

I have brought this to the attention of the manager at the Sunnyvale location. He was very nice and polite. He told me he would bring it to the attention of upper management. 

Thank you!

Here is one to think about.  As you know, we are going to have Super Bowl City madness for about 8 or 9 days all around us.  Rather than le tting those nice Black and Stainless tumblers sit there, put them on sale for 30-40% off during Super Bowl City week.  You will still make a little profi t but more importantly,  be advertising your store and location to the 1000's of fans and visitors that will wandering the area for 7 or 8 days.

I'm suggesting some sort of loyalty pr ogram for your customers.   Would love to buy a stainless 16 Oz coffee/tea tumbler, but the price is rather high.  How about a loyalty card that is stamp ted, and your loyal customer's would get a free drink after 10 or 15 purchases.  

Alternately, let us buy a stainless tumbler for 50% off after 20 or 30  drink purchases.  That way we would get a nice product at a discount and help to advertise our new coffee/tea hangout.",581

I'm thrilled to hear about the strategy development. I knew Faisal back when I lived  near 24th in 2006. I had spoken with Jacob about a month ago and there didn't seem to be any investment in marketing at that time. I told him that this would be the perfect time to have a saturated hyper local media mix campaign since the social engagement is already huge locally and there's so much buzz . Layering those impressions across different media will only catapult the current growth and popularity. Stoked for you guys!

I have played in a band since I was about 1 5 or so called The Calamity and we did well over 100 concerts in the time the band was together. We played venues such as The Big Butler Fair, The Hardro ck Caf , TJ's Hideaway, and many more in Pittsburgh. For the past 2 years, I have been doing solo shows all around the Pitsburgh area and have played som e pretty big events as well such as  The Pittsburgh Regatta, Pyrofest, Latitude 360, The Doublewide Grille, and many others in between. I would love to h ave the opportunity to play music in my hometown and a cool place such as this. The style I play is very similar to the way Ed Sheeran plays which is by himself, with a loop pedal to make it sound like a full band is playing, but he is solo. If you have any interest in setting something up or hearing more , that would be awesome.",947

All Philz Coffee stores have Ordered Ahead that don't  currently have it. Could you please listen to your Fan on the Philz Coffee Facebook page that request a Philz Coffee to open in their area. Lastly could  you please expand into other parts of San Francisco please. Not just expand in the San Francisco downtown. I think these suggestions or ideas might my P hilz Coffee better.,635

I was a patron at your restaurant Coupa Cafe last night and the service was the worst I have ever experienced. The waitress, a young girl n ever came to greet us to take our drink order until we waved her down. She never brought us the appetizer we ordered. Every time we needed her she was be hind the bar playing on her cell phone or chatting with her co-worker completely oblivious to her customers. I counted 4 times that we needed to get up a nd go get her. I thought at the very least she could have comped us the single scoop of ice cream we ordered for my son which she charged us $5 for. Ther e was not a single other customer in the restaurant the entire hour and a half that we were there and I think I can see why now. Every restaurant on eith er side of you on Canon is busy but Coupa cafe. I think something should be done for this horrible service which we paid $85 for",898

Today I used  orderahead at 7:30 for the Redwood City store and it said it would  be ready in 20 minutes (after I order - in other words nothing I c an do about it then). I arrived a few minutes later (because I'm al ready driving there) and asked somebody behind the counter if it wa s possible to start my drink or if I could stand in line and then a sk them to start my drink - he told me my drink was already being m ade - so I'm thinking ""awesome, it's not really going to be 20 minu tes.""

Several minutes later the line is completely gone and I am s till standing there so I asked again if my drink is being made or i f I should go to the baristas and ask them to make it and he tells me it probably won't be ready until 750.  So I ask him if they can just start making it now and he says that they have to go in the or der that the drinks are ordered in the order ahead app. 

So I say yes but I'm here in person - why can't I just stand in line like ot her people and order the drink - especially since now there is no m ore line? And he says ""that's the risk you run when use the order a head app."" 

So again I press - ""I don't understand why if I'm here  in person I can't ask them to start making my drink which I would be able to do if I simply walked in?"" And he tells me that would be  a waste of time if they're already making it. So I ask again - are  they making it? 

He says they are & I see the barrista he is talk ing to. I stand there and wait. After several minutes I ask her ""ar e you making a tantalizing Turkish for heather?"" - she looks down, hands me my drink (and it's now 7:50) - I take the top off - there is no mint. I ask if she can add the mint - she looks annoyed, says  nothing and puts two tiny leafs in. 

I asked for more (and got it ) but by now I am feeling like this was a really bad start to my mo rning.... 

Believe me, I wouldn't take the time to share this feed back if I didn't really like your business. I hope you guys can fig ure out how to keep creating a great customer experience and maybe resolve some of these small but meaningful issues.",2492

Both times the coffee power did not dissolve completely. It precipitated at the bottom of the cup. The coffee made me feel so sick and shake. I don't know how to comment on this but I feel like the composition of the mocha is just not right. Would you please make sure the coffee will be well mixed and not contain stuff that would cause such sickness and anxiety? I didn't have the same problem with Starbucks or Coffee and Tea Leaf.

I love your Mint Mojito Iced Coffee and got addicted to it. However, I did not get good experience s at this location 3 times. Each visit I have to wait for about 30 minutes. Everytime I ordered my drink, then I go paid for it. When I came back to the server and wait for my drink, they always served the drinks to 2-3 customers ordered after me, it happened twice to me. I thought my MintMojito took long er to make, but the server gave other customers their orders (Mint Mojito as well) and forgot about my drink. When I asked for my drink, so she couldnt r emember my drink. Both times 2 servers took too many order at a times and totally forgot about my order. This happened 2 out of 3 times I've been there. I bring this up hopefully that you would consider some ways like get the customer's name and order so that way there is no confusion about the drinks or the customer who ordered what.",951

I love philz coffee but this bothered me so much I just walked out. I stood in line for a good 5 minutes, made eye contact with all 3 baristas a couple times, and was never greeted or even acknowledge a n ""I'll be right with you or thank you for waiting"". 

I've been to all the philz around the city and I guess this location just didn't feel welcoming an d personal like all your other stores. Just thought I'd text this here because I saw a little sign that said to text feedback to this number.

We just visited the westborough location and had a pretty unfortunate experience. We go to Philz in SF every single day, in all different neighbor hoods, and have had 100% amazing, wonderful experiences. This morning, we were treated gruffly by the barista who ignored me when I asked her how she was , and made both of our orders incorrectly. She was unapologetic when I told her I'm allergic to regular milk (I had clearly asked for almond). I was shoc ked that a Philz location would be run at a totally different caliber than the several locations in SF. My hope is that this location can hire better bar istas and the manager can instill the true Philz way, especially as Phil is expanding domestically now. If this location can't be run properly, I'm conce rned about the long term future of Philz. I love love love every Philz experience I've ever had, which is why I'm so concerned about this unfortunate int eraction. I will continue to visit the SF locations, but I will not be returning here. Thank you!",1021

Wanted to let you know there's a homeless guy who was there, first just drinking his coffee but then just starte d walking around the tables mumbling, went into a building, came back out, talked to another patron's dog. He was quite pungent. Big guy with white hair & beard. Not sure what you can do about this. He did buy coffee and the staff respected him like any other customer as they should (kudos to your excelle nt staff btw). I think that's the right thing to do. We shouldn't shun the homeless but maybe mgmt can ask him nicely to obey some ediquette rules (and p erhaps get him some clean clothes).

Had the megaburger quesadilla.  Was fantastic and an unusual interpation of both.  B eing from San Antonio and big fans of bugers and quesadillas it is a great complament.  the queso was sublime with the use of real cheese sauce rather t han processed cheese sauce with just the right seasonings.  One suggestion-add some garlic and cumin to your salsa.  Nancy Jones,434

Those are 2.00 not 1.25. On.top of that u don't even offer a car wash or anything for my inconvenience and now u can't even make a check out for the corrrect amount. After I gave you a good rating i actually will not be following on you nor will I be referring to you because as you know its not easy these days with the Economy and I put money in YOUR machine and you can't even refund it back in the whole amount..bullshit now I know why u have no one on site. Thieves. Keep the fucking money and ill make sure everyone knows . I'm pissed.
And considering the cost of gas now , I wasted not only my gas but my time involving you because ur machine ripped me off then you can't even pay me what u took. Maybe with the money u take from.customers you should get new spot removers. And thanks for offering nothing in return that's a shitty customer service if u ask me and maybe if u could TALK u might remember what u owe me.

I had the mango habanero chicken pizza today. The service was good,  the food arrived pretty quickly and was hot and attractive in appea rance.  
That's where it ends.  I consider myself a ""foodie"" and eat interesting combinations of food often.  This was not good to me in the least.  It h ad nice spice,  but was overly sweet,  as if it were a Hawaiian chicken pizza with jam poured over the top. I expected some sweetness with mango habanero  sauce and pineapple,  but this was completely over the top for a savory dish. This was honestly sweet enough to be a dessert pizza, except for the chick en on it. 
You asked for feedback: this is mine. 
Thank you for listening,

I want you to succeed here, but inconsistent quality is a killer. It why I never eat at Fish Ne t, and on occasion I've had great food there. 
Personally, I'm not inclined to frequent or recommend places that have food quality concerns. 
I debated a bout sending this but know that you can't fix it if you don't know about it. 
Good luck....!

We had some friends recommend Mirage for good pizza. We decided last night to try pizza & beer there. We were seated & our server Nathan came over to take our drink orders & told us some of his faves. We had already made our minds up for the supreme pizza & amber  Bach beer. He came back with our beer & shakers of cheese & peppers. As I was sipping on my beer I caught a glimpse of something . It was a live roach i n the Parmesan cheese shaker! Got Nathan's attention & he very discreetly took away the shaker & brought us a fresh one. He apologized  several times. Ab out 20 min later our pizza arrived. It looked delicious! Took a bite & it was barely warm not pipping hot like you would expect. The service was great bu t I am sorry to say our first impression was not the best. We have out of town guests coming this next weekend & had hoped to take them to Mirage.,915

Some weeks ago I texted Coupa to complain about the service we had received from the manager there. My friend and I were invited back via reply to my text for a complimentary lunch. It is now my pleasure to write a followup on our very enjoyable experience today. 

As soon as we arrived my companion asked for Julio, and identified himself as someone to whom a gift card had been offered.  After  their conversation, both men came over to me, and Julio graciously apologized, humbly and profusely, providing an understandable explanation while nevertheless accepting full blame. I am convinced of his sincerity, and could see that he is a normally warm and kind person who was simply caught on a day of  unusual pressure from extraordinary duties. Coupa was extremely busy yesterday, but Julio made time twice to personally make sure my companion and I wer e enjoying our meal and our experience. We were. And Julio graciously apologized to us one more time as we left.

Julio has completely turned this situation around, and is to be  commended for his grace in doing so. His has the right stuff to be successful manager and an asset to the company. Because of Julio's impressive handling of my complaint, my friend and I will remain loyal customers and will encourage our friends to visit Coupa as well.

Coupa Cafe - Golf Course,"198 Junipero Serra Blvd, Stanford, CA 94305, United States 94305",SMS-+16505757555,5/6/2015 17:05,13,"My friend and I are regular customers at the Coupa at the Stanford Golf Course. We have had breakfasts and lunches there many, many times -- always a ple asure. Until last Friday.

We arrived at 11:40 for lunch.  The tables were entirely empty except for two at the far end.  So we sat down at the first of the many empty tables by the window -- as we always do. Suddenly some pup I've never seen and whose name I learned is Julio comes zipping over to us.  An d the first words out of his mouth? Welcome to Coupa? No. He asks us if we've put our names in at the bar, informing us that unless we do the servers won 't take our order. Never, in dozens of visits have we ever needed to put our names anywhere. Miraculously, the wait staff somehow notices customers seate d at a table without it. But given that the place was practically empty, instead of telling us to get up and march off on some quest to earn the right to  order lunch, a manager that wants return customers would have either done it for us, or simply waved one of the servers over. It's not like any of them were busy as fewer than four tables in the entire cafe had any occupants at all. But he didn't do either.

Julio leaves, then a minute later returns and says, indicating a table for two slammed up against an interior wall, ""I'm going to have to tell you to move over here. We need that table for rush hour. "" Not even ""Would you mind?"" Just a straight up command. Rather than move us to the tiny table against the wall, Julio could just as easily have offerred  us either of the comfortable, empty two-person tables by the window. But no. He gave us but one option and withdrew. 

I would have walked out then but my companion's hunger trumped my aggravation.  So we wandered on our own until we found two available two-person tables by the window and sat at one. And  even though we hadn't signed in, I noticed that somehow a waitperson managed to find us anyway.  An hour later our original four-person table, plus two others like it, were eventually occupied.  I noted that in each case, they were occupied by parties of two, just like my friend and I who had been told w e couldn't sit there. Except, unlike my friend, no one seated at the the other tables was Black.

I am by no means calling for Julio's job, and you haven 't lost me as a customer. I have always really liked the place. (There us one charming Hispanic waitperson in particular who is a delight and naturally s killed with people whom I absolutely adore.) But five days later I'm still irritated enough at our treatment at the hands of this particular manager to b e sending this text.  You may need to teach that very self-impressed person that managing a cafe doesn't make him Napoleon, and his job is not ordering c ustomers around, particularly when there is evidence to suggest that a customer may have been singled out for it.",2888

Coupa Cafe - Green Library ,"571 Escondido Mall, Stanford, CA 94305, United States 94305",SMS-+14152318879,4/3/2015 21:08,13,"Hi there, I've been using coupa for months (the ones in the university by engineering and by the green library), and I've loved it - it's rare to find a business that puts the quality first, and affordability, and staff friendliness. And coupa used to do that so well, I really enjoyed going to get my coff ee there, and the staff particularly have been so fantastic. One of the things I loved most was having a rich, delicious coffee - it really was so good. A lot of coffee in America is very weak, sweet, and not very good, but coupa coffee used to be fantastic. Also I loved being able to get water there, ice d, and infuse with lemon or strawberries - it really made me so happy! However, over the last week I think something has changed with the coffee, it's no t so strong now, something has changed in it, and it sometimes almost tastes watered down now. Perhaps different beans are being used? And the water is n o longer available which is very sad. I understand the need to put prices up now and again, and your staff will always be fantastic, but I think the coff ee has got worse as it is weaker, and it's sad that the water is no longer available. These were things that I think make a good business and keep people  coming back, so i'm very sad they have gone. I may have to start making my coffee at home and bringing it in with me, with water also, as I was very ver y happy to pay the price when the product was so good, and the coffee full and rich, but it's harder to justify the price to myself in my weekly budget n ow, because I don't think it's what it used to be. A real shame. But I have loved all my other months of coupa coffee and water before that!  So thank yo u very much for that, and do tell your staff how fantastic they are. (And do please bring back the coffee as it use to be before, it was so good!! And th e water!!) And all the best with the business, I really do think it was fantastic, and very efficiently run, and thanks again.",1972

Seriously: having two, with different things to ""vote"" for on each one, got your employees WAY more tips. I'd bring the kid I nannied for and she would insist on putting money in the one I didn't want and we'd end up tipping twice.  Or there'd be something awesome on there and I'd be like, gotta put in a $5! With one, it's just a super boring tip jar.I know, you think there's not enough room on the counter for two. But it's marketing. It sends a very powerful message that Philz is indie and quirky and creative and supportive of its employees, and FUN. You left laughing at the cool doodles or ideas on the tip jars and being happy that you shopped here. It's well worth the extra few inches of counter space.

We love our Philz coffee!
The one glitch we have run into a number of times is that the newbies for some reason had a hard time making decaf  coffee that does not taste like water.
There must be some secret in how to pour it more slowly, or something, because our tried and true status make an awesome cup, but most new berries does will have to do it twice in order to get it right.
I suppose you just throw them right out there and let them lear n, trial by fire, but I thought I would point it out as it seems to be a bit of a theme.

Beautiful arrangement nice texture and  color. Great balance with eucalyptus and willow branches. Hob nail  glass vase is a great height and bold white shade that adds to the  colors of the arrangement and is non distracting. Change the bow. It is too small and the shiny ribbon throws off the opaqueness of f lower colors and vase. May I suggest a thick seafoam raffia or a wi de burlap ribbon.☺,495

A couple of comments: A simple cup of coffee took about five minutes.  There was as many staff as there were customers. The young lady who served me was very pleasant. The line formation was very unclear, people waiting for coffee were constantly mixed with those waiting to or der.  Confusing. My cup was overfilled, so when I placed a lid on the cup, it over flowed. The coffee was good. Having to decide about amount of sugar an d cream when ordering is inconvenient.  Depending on the coffee, sometimes I want a little cream or sugar, sometimes I want a little or a lot of sugar. N eed a sugar/cream bar.  Thanks for asking. Kerry Harris",670

I can't keep paying $5 each time so it ends up being an occasional treat. I'm a regular at Starbucks because they have more seating space, not as loud and is more affordable but taste in coffee is definitely not the same. I think Philz coffee is way better but too expensive for me to be a regular. Plus, I'm a gold member at Starbucks so even though I pay $2.25 for a tall coffee, I get free refills.

Ben is probably your best employee and his professionalism is tippy top. Your sales team is ver y below par... Nice guys and I like the no pressure approach but they move extremely slow. They also seem to know very little about Volvo cars and seem c lueless about accessories - this is a direct reflection of leadership as there must not be much training / motivation for your guys selling.  Your techno logy and system for completing a sale is also stuck in the stone ages.  Takes forever.  I even called ahead to make sure paperwork was drawn up but still  took 1.5 hours to buy the car.

I would have to rate it a 1 on a 10 point scale. We had to wait 30 minutes to get our drinks and be waited on. There were maybe 20 customers and 4 servers. That is not considered busy by any standard. We were waited on by someone who seemed to be a shift superviso r rather than a waiter/waitress. When the waitress (Carmen) finally got to our table, she made excuses about why she couldn't have been there an hour ago . We watched 3 other tables walk out without getting their appetizer or food and another table get a free entree due to the long wait. The waitresses wer e arguing with the supervisor in front of the customers. That is not professional. This is the second time we have attended this restaurant and the secon d time we have gotten this ""service"". I will not be recommending this restaurant to anyone until it has good service.",886

Thanks for your note.  The good news I was NOT in a hurry as I was with the woman I slept with last night and we were enjoying a leisurely SundayMorning at Philz.

More good news:  because it took so long to get my bagel, I finished my coffee in my official Philz metal and ceramic mug so I got asecond.

You guys got an extra $3 and I got a double whammy Philz buz.  

And now it's 12:45 and I have no need for lunch.

So all is well in my life here San Francisco due to Philz (and a great woman in bed last night).  It's hard to untangle whether it was the Philz coffee or getting a quick response from you that has me feeling so good right now...but I think the woman had a big role in my euphoric feeling right now LOL",740

I called the SM yesterday to advise that there is an Red Low Oil Pressure Light that has come on and off. He told me to come in this morning around 730. I came from San Pedro got there about 8am. I told him what's going on and also that my drivers side window is not going auto up. He then accused me of having a bad switch without properly diagnosing the issue. He then tells me that I shouldn't have written my review on here. He  then hands me my keys and saus to comeback when you're at the dealership at 12. I told the SM that my car is unsafe to drive as the low oil pressure lig ht came on and stalled. He told me he's not going to deal with this and I can comeback at 12 and work directly with you. So not only did I waste gas comi ng from San Pedro but my car is not even being looked but have to come back at noon when you're there and waste more gas.

They're called bartenders because they are suppose to tend to the bar and the customers who are wanting to use the bar. We've come two weekends in a row and both times have been disappointing. There has only been one waitress when we first came over to play pool who asked us if we needed anything without us having to get their attention or go to the bar and stand there for an excess amount of time till someone finally asked if we needed anything. From my business point of view I would find new staff to tend the bar, but I guess that's only one opinion in a place that should be full. However, there are only maybe a little over 10 people here.",822

The only thing we request is that your crew be professional, make eye contact and to let thecustomer know that they are aware that they are waiting. Additionally, if they are off the clock, get away from the back of the counter so customers will not think they are working and wonder why there was only one person waiting on customers.

As I said, we have been going to that location for about 7 years and i have been tolerant of the different crew that runs the store. However, the crew last night was just bad.

The rest were just preoccupied cleaning up, talking, and standing by the counter. One girl even sat at the manager's chair and was riding it in the hallway.

Here are a few suggestions: the lids to your cups are very hard to put on. I notice that they are the generic ""solo""brand lids whereas your cups are custom philz cups. Is it possible that they aren't actually a perfect fit? This can be very problematic when the scolding hotcoffee is filled to the very top. Often times it leaks out. Maybe have the employees offer to put the lid on? Also, the donuts are rather poor compared to yourcoffee. I would invest in better donuts. Thanks for listening! Love philz!",546

Growing up in the business industry I try not to get involved... I have to say something. I'm thinking of spending more time in Beverly Hills, coming from Hawaii... As far as clients coming to your establishment this may be profitable for you. This is a different Coupa that I knew. I began coming to the Coupa in Beverly Hills about 7-8 years ago (you can ask the guys who have been here years). Beverly Hills has gone through many changes, but a constant since 1912 is business. There are times of the year in BH where there are more tourist (this has changed over time), due to economic issues, changes in technology, and changes in the entertainment industry. This town is different than Palo Alto in many many ways. As a business you know you must be all about the clientele to make money. This can be done in many ways. Example: I wish to have a large book party somewhere. This would include live music, a place that is open till at LEAST midnight.You are in a prime location. The number one reason people tell me that they do not come to coupa is that it is closed. People who live here are mostly inthe entertainment industry, they don't eat dinner until 8, this is when you are closed/closing. Maybe someone who is running your business should see what this town is like 7 days a week from 8pm to midnight. I am saying this because I like this place and I'm coming back to Beverly Hills. This place hasso much potential but who ever owns this place needs to do something. Things are going to change in this town and this place needs to stay open later. Thanks. Annoyed customer who loves coupa - Skye MacQueen",1731

This is Hanna Dean. I'm sorry to bother you. We had a group of 16 come in last night for dinner, and the entire time we felt like a burden. Two of the girls asked for refills of water, and our waitress, Cheryl, rolled her eyes, sighed very loud, and said ""anything else"" in a horrible tone thatshe didn't try to cover up. She gave five of us the wrong tickets, left to get them fixed, and didn't come back for nearly 35 minutes. We sent a girl upto check on our tickets, and Cheryl was openly talking to the manager Darren about how irritated she was about how many of us there were. The girl we sent to check on the tickets was mocked by Darren when she told him how dissatisfied she was. The two of them acted very unprofessionally and disrespectful.I go to the mirage very often, and I have never had any problems during the day shift. I rarely ever call in anywhere, but last night was ridiculous,and I thought you should know, so it could be handled. Many of the girls openly stated that they will not be returning.",1033

Peter (white haired guy with glasses) has repeatedly come in, deposited his things on a table to reserve it, and just left the coffee shop. He regularly goes to get food for over an hour, takes up another table outside, or just walks in circles around the shop. Apparently, he doesn't even regularly buy coffee and just asks for free cups of warm milk. Today, I had an LSAT student who really wanted to take a full test and peter's table was the only open one. I don't want to share it with him because he freaks me out and has repeatedly taken advantage of baristas' time and finances (promising them work and then never paying them after they do it). All the baristas know who he is so you should have no trouble locating him. He makes Philz  a worse place for everyone. Can you or Jesse please have a frank discussion with
 him?

If I ask for an xtra hot drink and then im told by the barista that all drinks come out at 205degree and she asks""is that hot enough for ya?"" and th en im served a, at best, luke warm drink and when i taste it and ask if its really 205degrees and the barista responds with a swift ""all drinks come out  at 205."" i find her insincere. I went to another barista who nade me a proper ""hot"" chocalate. He relayed to me that the other one had too much cream w hich is why it was lukewarm.  If someone asks for xtra hot HOT chocalate, surly a barista should know that luke warm is not satisfactory and she must kn ow that when she adds sooo much cream that it will negate the 205......",683

I was surprised at how many folks stayed the whole or most of the day--says a lot about the quality of the event. The Jcc location was great and the food was very good. The breakout session with fewer attendees were the better ones. I would suggest keeping each breakout to no more than 25-35 folks. The one with Ron Conway was just too crowded. I've also moderated many of these and I always find it best to go around the room and get questions or areas of concerns from the attendees first to make sure that we cover the most important and interesting things. Finally, I would suggest going to a more standard fireside chat format for the keynotes...the back and forth questioning felt a bit awkward to me. Otherwise, an amazing event. Kol hakavod!

Told a group of women friends about my experience at Philz and our discussion.  This group goes to Tahoe each year.  This year one lady brought 16lbs of Philz.   It took us several pots to get the right grind/amount of cofee to water to get the taste right. We suggest you print on the bag the preparation info or have a Web link to the info as different coffee maker need different combos.

I ordered a vanilla frappe to go.  I told Richard how I liked the drink prepared. 6 pumps of vanilla, half & half up to almost ""8"" in blenderand ice to the top lip of glass, not bulging over top of glass.  Richard added ice before coffee and once adding the coffee, all the ice melted. I said,you'll have to make it again all the ice melted and we don't know how much creme to add at this point. He said. ""I'm not making this again"". I said, itis melted and it is an icee drink blended. He said.""What difference does it make, the ice melts anyway "".  
He walked away and eventually the older , bald man came and started making the drinks. I was one of three that was waiting to have drinks remade. 
I have been a customer for about 9 years at your store (and try to go to independently owned shops ) and have never had anyone speak to me in this manner when I was spending money in their store in any ofPalo Alto businesses. 
Richard raised his voice. I spoke to him in a respectful manner. 
Jobs are difficult to find. Please coach him in good customer service and how to make Coupa drinks. He is not ready for Prime Time. 

I gave complaining a lot of thought. I have had good relationships with your employees over the years. Because I worked with Homeland Security and USCIS I have helped your employees with immigration info. I have given $ to employee forkid's birthdays & outtings.

I don't appreciate such rude behavior because I like my beverage made a certain way. 
Thank you

I interpreted the two goals for your business as superior service and superior coffee to justify the 2X price compared with othets. This is what I found.

You have longer waits to get coffee: 13min for you vs 4 for the others
Still confusing multiple lines for you - one line for others
Unclear lines for your store- easy to understand lines forothers
Sometimes a warm greeting and dialog with customers but not typical for you and more often warm greetings at others
Coffee taste different at each store. Hard to tell which is better

I concluded that you have good goals but they aren't being fulfilled. Suggest you assess from a customers view point",772

The line would be on the Forest side. Staff with tablets would great customers,  take order and customer name. Order would be sent to barista and cashier.  Cashier would finalize cash transaction. Card transactions could be finalized on tablet. Barista focuses on fulfilling order. Customer stands or sits until order is filled. Customers name is displayed on a board when order is ready so the batista doesn't need to try and bellow above the music.",515

First, most coffee shops give you a free cup when you buy only 1 pound.Your cups are more expensive so I think 2 pounds should be min for a free cup.

Also most home brewersbuy smaller quantities to maintain freshness; three pounds is just too much and makes me feel like you don't value your bean customers enough.",447
